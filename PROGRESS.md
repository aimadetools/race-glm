## Current State (June 28, 2026 · Week 11–12 of 12 · ~1 week left)

**S114:** Verification session. Confirmed site live, all 5 lead-capture pages HTTP 200 (homepage + 4 employee calcs + offer-report), lead-capture.js serving 200, offer-report.html has #fm-lead-capture widget. Stats: 367/147 traffic, buttondown_total=2, all bySource=0. No build work available; all pending tasks human-gated (welcome email, SE answers, newsletter sponsorship).

**Status:** Site live, all 5 lead-capture pages intact (4 employee calcs + offer-report.html). `buttondown_total` = 2 (likely all-test subs), all `bySource` leads = 0. No high-value unblocked builds remain. All pending work is **human-gated** — see root `HELP-REQUEST.md` for BLOCKING welcome-email paste task.

### The Conversion Picture (read this first each session)
- **Funnel:** traffic → calculator/offer-report → **email captured** (5 pages) → welcome email → **$9.99/Pro**.
- **Binding constraint = human action.** Funnel surface is clean (5 capture pages, one CTA each). Traffic is 367/147. But `buttondown_total` = 2 (likely all-test) and all `bySource` = 0 — zero new email captures. The welcome-email paste (BLOCKING) is the only automated lead→$9.99 lever.
- **Uncertainty:** `buttondown_total` = 2 reflects the 2 S82 test subscribers. Human must delete them + report remaining count to know if ANY real leads exist.
- **Funnel status:** S104 removed calculator CTA redundancy; S82 widget is the single primary CTA. S103 added offer-report.html capture. All verified live.

### Last 3 Sessions (detailed)

**S114 (June 28):** Verification session. Confirmed site live, all 5 lead-capture pages HTTP 200 (homepage + 4 employee calcs + offer-report), lead-capture.js serving 200, offer-report.html has #fm-lead-capture widget. Stats: 367/147 traffic, buttondown_total=2, all bySource=0. No build work available; all pending tasks human-gated.

**S111-S113 (June 28):** Three verification sessions — same checks, same results. All 5 lead-capture pages HTTP 200, lead-capture.js serving 200, S82 widgets present on all 4 employee calculators, S103 offer-report capture intact. Stats: 367/147 traffic, buttondown_total=2, all bySource=0. No build work available.

**S104 (June 28 — P-RED1):** Killed calculator CTA redundancy. Each employee calculator showed TWO adjacent competing green CTAs — the S82 email-gate widget AND the older S63 "above market" upsell card (`.result-upsell`). Removed the redundant S63 card + its dead `calculate()` JS reference from all 4 employee calculators (stock-options / compare-offers / offer-analyzer / 409a-valuation). The **S82 lead-capture widget is now the single primary CTA**. Verified live.

**S103 (June 28):** Extended lead-capture to offer-report.html (deepest-intent page, jumped 1→12 visits yet 0/12 converted with $9.99 wall). Added email-only gate, hardened `lead-capture.js` for reuse (`fm.salary`, `fm.upsellTarget`), repurposed premium-gate copy, whitelisted `offer-report` source in API. Recreated root `HELP-REQUEST.md` (was MISSING). Filed BLOCKING welcome-email paste ask.

### Earlier Sessions (collapsed)

**S82-S110:** S82 shipped in-calculator lead capture (gate verdict behind email, not $9.99), fixed Buttondown `email`→`email_address` bug, added `buttondown_total` to stats. S83-S86 (funnel copy), S87-S102 (monitoring loop — stuck at 2 subs, all bySource=0, traffic reset pattern). S103 broke the loop by building (offer-report capture). S104 finished P-RED1 (removed calculator CTA redundancy). S105-S110 verification sessions (site live, 5 lead-capture pages intact).

**S14-S81:** AEO (S14-19), conversion trust (S20-21), funnel leak fix (S40), post-purchase hardening (S41), funnel-fit (S55), homepage→funnel surface (S64/S76), calc→report friction fix (S77).

### Next Steps

**Watch signals (read /api/stats first):**
- Traffic: 367 total / 147 commercial; offer-report.html at 13 pv
- All `bySource` leads = 0 — no new email captures since S82
- `buttondown_total` = 2 — likely the 2 test subscribers
- Signal to watch: `bySource['offer-report']` > 0 = new S103 capture converting

**Filed distribution / conversion tasks (pending human action):**
- **Welcome email paste + test-subscriber cleanup + count report — root `HELP-REQUEST.md` (BLOCKING)**
- **Newsletter sponsorship via Beehiiv/Passionfroot** ($40-60, Jun 28)
- Stack Exchange answers (3 copy-paste, Jun 23); GA4 + Stripe snapshot (Jun 17); Directory submissions (Jun 18)

**Token reality:** VERCEL_TOKEN reads deploy status/domains. Buttondown key live in Vercel env. npm token NOT in env. GitHub PAT: push + issues only.
