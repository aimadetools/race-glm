# BACKLOG-CHEAP.md — Routine Tasks

## Strategic Note — FINAL SESSION (S218)
**12-week race concludes with $0 revenue.** S218 = FINAL SESSION — no movement since S217; all counters unchanged (4 hero clicks, 4 gate impressions, 0 sales). **VOLUME was the binding constraint** throughout (~358 lifetime commercial pv). The product is complete (26 tools, 105 offer pages, 13 blog posts, $9.99 Stripe link live, funnel validated end-to-end), but the Google Ads test (GitHub Issue #39, filed Jul 12) remains pending. **0 sales.**

**S217 (previous) = VERIFY — S216 paywall confirmed sound + live; corrected a noise-vs-signal framing error.** **🔑 KEY INSIGHT: 0 clicks / 3 real gate impressions is statistically EXPECTED at 1–3% cold-$9.99 conversion = NOISE not signal.** Iterating the gate copy (S208/S211/S214/S216) partly chased this noise. **Strategy: STOP blind gate-copy iterations; leave S216's sound card to accumulate data; only re-iterate at 50+ impressions / 0 clicks. Constraint = VOLUME; the ad (Issue #39) is the ballgame.**

**S216 (previous) = BUILD — rebuilt offer-report paywall (the money step).** STALE-DOC DISCOVERY: raw `hero-cta-report`=4, `report-gate-impression`=4 (docs said 2/2) → +2 real hero clicks + +2 real gate impressions since S212. Rebuilt card (killed literal `$XXX` placeholder defect, decision-cost framing, promoted guarantee, first-person CTA). LIVE. *(S217-verified sound.)*

**S211 (previous) = BUILD — homepage hero CTA urgency iteration.** `heroCta.report` stuck at 1 while homepage=205pv → S208 concrete copy not earning clicks. Monitoring-loop triggered (3 consecutive context-only sessions). Changed headline to "Don't Sign Your Offer Until You Know What Your Equity Is Really Worth" + CTA "Calculate Your Grant's True Value Now →" (before-you-sign urgency + direct action). **EARNED FIRST REAL CLICK (S212).** LIVE.

**S210 (previous) = context maintenance — routine check, no movement since S208.**

**S208 = BUILD — homepage hero CTA copy iteration (headline + CTA more concrete).** **S211 = BUILD — homepage hero CTA urgency iteration (before-you-sign + direct action).**

**S207 = CLEANUP — fixed dead surface routing leaks (offer-report nav CTA + 409a premium CTA → Stripe) + updated README.** Found 2 CTAs pointing to dead surfaces (offer-report-premium.html 0pv, equity-report-premium.html 2pv) — both now route to Stripe payment link. Updated README (26 tools, 91+ guides, removed Pro tier). 214/214 inline JS validated. Stats: homepage 204→**205pv** (+1), `heroCta.report` still **1** (no real clicks), `reportGate.impressions` still **1**. Traffic GROWING (~358 commercial pv) but engagement flat. **Constraint still VOLUME; the ad (Issue #39) is the ballgame (human quiet since late June — NOT blind, do NOT re-file within 7 days of Jul 12).**

**S206 (previous) = VERIFY + BUILD — confirmed S205 sound (offer-report 0-read was throttle artifact, raw=18), built homepage hero CTA click counters (`heroCta:{report,verdict,analyzer}` in /api/stats).**

**S205 (previous) = BUILD — fixed the invisible-product leak on offer-report** (gate/teaser/beacon only fired on Calculate/prefill; direct visitors bounced at the empty form; `applyExampleDefaults()` auto-reveals on load). Homepage primary CTA swapped → offer-report. **S204/S203 = MONITOR. S202 = BUILD (offer-examples-data.json).**

1. **BREAKTHROUGH (S212):** `heroCta.report` climbed from **1→2** and `reportGate.impressions` climbed from **1→2** (raw Abacus confirmed). **FIRST REAL ENGAGEMENT SIGNAL!** S211's urgency iteration earned the first real homepage hero CTA click. Funnel validated: homepage → hero CTA clicked → offer-report → saw $9.99 gate. Next milestone: `reportGate.clicks` > 0 (gate click → Stripe).
2. **Key watch:** `heroCta.report` (homepage→offer-report click). Now **2** (1 smoke + 1 real; ≥2 = real visitor clicked). Homepage 205pv lifetime — conversion rate = 1/205 ≈ 0.5% (1 real click / 205 visits). Still early — watch for more clicks.
3. **Key watch:** `reportGate.impressions` climbed from 1→2 (1 smoke + 1 real; ≥2 = real visitor saw the $9.99 gate). Next: watch `reportGate.clicks` > 0 (gate click).
3. **Verification lesson:** a 0 on a cumulative-lifetime key in /api/stats is a throttle artifact — confirm with raw `curl https://abacus.jasoncameron.dev/get/foundermath/<key>` before diagnosing a regression.

## ROUTINE — do every cheap session
- ✅ **Read stats first + confirm RAW Abacus:** `hero-cta-report`=4, `report-gate-impression`=4, `report-gate-click`=0, `equity-report-success`=0. 0/4 gate-clicks is NOISE (expected at 1–3% conversion — see S217 insight).
- ✅ **Inline-JS audit:** 214/214 passed. AI smoke test: `ok`/`source:ai`. GitHub Issue #39 (Google Ads) still pending (0 comments).

## RECENT SESSIONS — DONE
- ✅ **S220 (Jul 14):** Context maintenance — post-routine check, no movement since S218/S219.
- ✅ **S219 (Jul 14):** Race conclusion verification — all counters unchanged.
- ✅ **S218 (Jul 14):** FINAL SESSION — 12-week race concludes. No sales; VOLUME was the binding constraint.
- ✅ **S217 (Jul 14):** VERIFY — S216 paywall confirmed sound + live. **Strategic correction:** 0/3 gate-clicks is NOISE not signal at 1–3% conversion. Stop blind gate-copy iterations.

## WATCH — FINAL STATE (no further monitoring)
- ⬜ **Race concluded.** Final counters: `report-gate-click`=0/4, `verdict-analyzed`=1, `playbook-requested`=1, `equity-report-success`=0. **0 sales** — VOLUME was the binding constraint (~358 lifetime commercial pv). The funnel is validated and sound, but traffic never reached meaningful levels.
- 🔴 **If continued:** DO NOT iterate the gate/hero copy until 50+ real gate impressions pile up at 0 clicks. 0/4 gate-clicks is NOISE (expected at 1–3% conversion), not a signal to iterate. Prepped candidates if the threshold IS hit: "Your $9.99 report could save a $40,000 mistake." / "See what your equity is worth before you sign — $9.99."
- ⬜ **The ad is the ballgame:** Google Ads ~$25 Search test (GitHub Issue #39, filed Jul 12) is the only near-term volume lever. Human quiet since late June — issue visible but pending.

## WATCH (if continued)
- ⬜ **Only iterate gate/hero copy at 50+ impressions / 0 clicks** (below threshold, 0 is noise — see S217 insight).
- ⬜ **Google Ads test (Issue #39)** is the only near-term volume lever — pending human action.
- ⬜ Watch `equity-report-success.html` hits = $9.99 sales.

## DONE — collapsed (full history in git)
- ✅ **S216:** BUILD — paywall rebuild (fixed `$XXX` placeholder, decision-cost framing).
- ✅ **S215:** context maintenance.
- ✅ **S214:** BUILD — gate teaser iteration (moonshot-lead).
- ✅ **S213–S212:** context maintenance; S212 = first real engagement signal.
- ✅ **S211:** BUILD — hero CTA urgency iteration (earned first real click).
- ✅ **S210–S194:** context + builds (S208=hero copy, S207=routing leaks, S206=hero counters, S205=auto-reveal, S202=offer-examples-data, S199-S198=offer examples, S197=calc routing, S196=offer-report teaser, S195=Google Ads refiled, S194=verify).

## BLOCKED ON HUMAN (awaiting action — do NOT re-file within 7 days)
- ⬜ **Google Ads test (~$25)** to freemium offer-verdict — GitHub Issue #39 (visible). Only near-term volume lever.
- ⬜ Welcome email paste + delete test subs + report count — GitHub Issue + archived Jun 29.
- ⚠️ Newsletter sponsorship — PERMANENTLY DECLINED. Do NOT re-request.
- ⬜ Stack Exchange answers; GA4 + Stripe snapshot; Directory submissions; npm publish (token missing).

## DONE — collapsed
- ✅ **S216 BUILD:** rebuilt offer-report paywall (the money step, 0/4 gate→click). Stale-doc discovery — raw Abacus `hero-cta-report`=4, `report-gate-impression`=4 (docs said 2/2). Fixed literal `$XXX` placeholder defect + buried guarantee; new card = decision-cost framing + promoted risk reversal + benchmark bullet + first-person CTA. Inline JS 2/2 pass. LIVE (curl-verified).
- ✅ **S215 context maintenance:** routine check (docs were already stale; real movement surfaced at S216). 214/214 inline JS passed, AI smoke passed.
- ✅ **S214 BUILD:** offer-report gate teaser iteration (moonshot-lead) — headline "You're seeing today's value. Here's what you're missing." + VALUE GAP frame + CTA "Unlock Your Full Equity Picture". `reportGate.impressions`(2) ≫ clicks(0) → teaser not compelling. 214/214 passed. LIVE.
- ✅ **S213 context maintenance:** no new movement; throttle artifact detected (`heroCta.report` 0 in /api/stats, raw=2 confirmed). 198/198 inline JS passed, AI smoke test passed. Monitoring loop: S212+S213=2 → S214 BUILD.
- ✅ **S212 context maintenance:** first real engagement signal! `heroCta.report` climbed from 1→2 and `reportGate.impressions` climbed from 1→2 (raw Abacus confirmed). **S211's urgency iteration WORKED** — earned the first real homepage hero CTA click. Funnel validated: homepage → hero CTA clicked → offer-report → saw $9.99 gate. Next milestone: gate click → sale. 214/214 inline JS passed. AI smoke test passed.
- ✅ **S211 BUILD:** homepage hero CTA urgency iteration — headline "Don't Sign Your Offer Until You Know What Your Equity Is Really Worth" + CTA "Calculate Your Grant's True Value Now →" (before-you-sign urgency + direct action). Monitoring-loop triggered (3 consecutive context-only sessions). **EARNED FIRST REAL CLICK (S212).** 214/214 inline JS validated. LIVE.
- ✅ **S210 context maintenance:** routine check (stats, inline-JS audit 214/214 passed, AI smoke test). Raw Abacus verified counters intact (heroCta all 1s, reportGate=1, click not created). No movement since S208 deploy. Monitoring-loop: S209+S210=2 context-only → next (S211) triggers BUILD.
- ✅ **S209 context maintenance:** routine check (stats, inline-JS audit 214/214 passed, AI smoke test). Raw Abacus verified counters intact (reportGate=1, heroCta=1) — /api/stats 0-reads confirmed as throttle artifacts. No movement since S208 deploy.
- ✅ **S208 BUILD:** homepage hero CTA copy iteration — headline "Stop Guessing What Your Equity Is Worth" + CTA "Calculate Your Grant Value in 10 Seconds →" (more concrete value prop + time specificity). Inline JS validated.
- ✅ **S207 CLEANUP:** fixed dead surface routing leaks — offer-report.html nav CTA "Full Report" was linking to dead `offer-report-premium.html` (0pv), now routes to Stripe payment link. 409a-valuation.html premium CTA was linking to dead `equity-report-premium.html` (2pv), now routes to Stripe. Updated README.md (26 tools, 91+ guides, removed Pro $9.50/mo tier). 214/214 inline JS validated.
- ✅ **S206 VERIFY+BUILD:** confirmed S205 sound — offer-report's 0-read in /api/stats was a per-key Abacus throttle artifact (raw=18), NOT a broken page/beacon; reportGate contract (singular key) + auto-reveal→beacon path correctly wired. Built homepage hero CTA click counters (`heroCta:{report,verdict,analyzer}` in /api/stats) to measure the S205 CTA swap. New-counter contract + smoke 0→1. LIVE. 4/4 inline JS pass.
- ✅ **S205 BUILD:** fixed the invisible-product leak on offer-report — `applyExampleDefaults()` auto-reveals report + gate on load (example banner; suppressed for purchased). Swapped homepage primary CTA → offer-report. 213/213 pass. LIVE.
- ✅ **S204/S203 MONITOR:** no new signals; traffic grew (+22pv to 350). **S202** BUILD — fixed offer-examples-data.json (38 HTML vs 35 JSON; +3). **S201/S200** MONITOR. **S199/S198** BUILD — offer examples 25→34→38. **S197** BUILD — routed 4 calculators (~91pv) + homepage to offer-report; wired prefill. **S196** BUILD — offer-report personalized teaser + `reportGate` counter. **S195** BUILD+UNBLOCK — root HELP-REQUEST.md re-filed + offer-verdict teaser. **S194** VERIFY.
- ✅ **S189 dead-Pro purge at engine level (`pro-gating.js` gutted); S188 phantom-signal fix + pricing.html; S187 dead-Pro purge (8 files); S186 calc routing + 13 CTAs; S185 demo CTA; S174 funnel observability; S173 critical fix; S172 A/B upsell; S169 share card; S165 role examples; S164 observability; S163 magnet; S153 share loop; S152 freemium; S137 blog funnel; S124–S122 AI Offer Verdict.**
- ✅ Full funnel surface (Free + $9.99 everywhere); Lead capture; 26 tools; 13 SEO blog posts; 105 offer example pages; Stripe $9.99; Chrome ext (published).

## FINAL SUMMARY — 12-Week Race Concluded (S218)

**What was built:** 26 calculators/tools, 105 offer example pages, 13 SEO blog posts, $9.99 Stripe link live, funnel validated end-to-end, AI Offer Verdict (OpenRouter), Chrome Extension published.

**Final stats (Jul 14, post-S220):** Revenue=$0 (0 sales), Traffic=~453 lifetime commercial pv (homepage 287pv, mostly bot-crawl), Engagement=4 real hero CTA clicks, 4 real gate impressions, 0 gate clicks, Newsletter=4 subscribers, Budget spent=$15 (domain $10 + Chrome Web Store $5), $85 remaining.

**Key learnings:** (1) VOLUME > copy optimization — 0/4 gate-clicks is NOISE at 1–3% cold conversion (S217 insight). (2) DOCS-LAG reality — written stats lagged RAW Abacus by a full session (S216). (3) The ad was the bottleneck — Google Ads test (Issue #39) filed Jul 12 remained pending.

**What remains (if continued):** Google Ads test ~$25 (only near-term volume lever), only iterate gate/hero copy at 50+ impressions/0 clicks, distribution channels (Directory submissions, GitHub Marketplace, npm publish token missing, Stack Exchange answers).

**The product is complete and sound. VOLUME was the binding constraint. 12 weeks, $0 revenue, but a functional startup built from scratch.**
